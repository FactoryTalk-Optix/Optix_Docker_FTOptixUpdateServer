## Introduction

This repository contains the required files to build and run a Docker Container with the Factory Talk Optix Update Service.

- This procedure involves some good knowledge of Linux systems and Docker containers and it is intended for advanced users
- The default entrypoint is the `FTOptixApplicationUpdateServer` itself
- The final container should be set to restart automatically on fail. 
- Upgrade of the `UpdateServer` via FT Optix IDE is not supported
- Default user is `root` and password is `FactoryTalkOptix`
- In order to activate a license and run the container for more than 120 minutes, an internet connectivity to the Rockwell Automation cloud must be available at all times
    - If no internet connectivity is available, the FT Optix Application will be stopped after 120 minutes and must be deployed again from FT Optix Studio
    - The license is passed to the container as an environment variable, this variable is then periodically checked to a Rockwell Automation server in order to check its validity

## Requirements

- Docker engine must be installed and running
    - Refer to the ([official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
    - (optional) Set users right to access Docker socket with either one of these steps if you want to execute the container as non root:
        - Changing the socket permissions with: `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock` (valid up to next reboot)
        - Configuring the Docker group ([official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/))
            - Add the new group: `sudo groupadd docker`
            - Add the current user to the Docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
            - Reboot the machine to apply changes
- FT Optix studio installed on  your development machine
    - Licensing on Docker containers is only supported starting from FT Optix 1.4.X
- A proper Runtime license must be available to execute the container for more than two hours
    - This step is optional, if not properly licensed, the FT Optix Application will stop after 120 minutes and must be deployed again
- Get the latest Runtime Tools for Ubuntu x86-64 (see below)

## Container setup

3. Verify the image was built with `docker images`

```bash
root@ubuntu-VirtualBox:# docker images
REPOSITORY                TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
ftoptix-updateserver      latest     18eba74533fb   1 minutes ago   355MB
root@ubuntu-VirtualBox:#
```

## Container execution

Now that the container is ready, we can execute it and deploy the FT Optix Application

### Execute the Docker container

In this example we will assume that the base image is called `ftoptix-updateserver`, if you tagged the container with a different name, you may need to adapt the commands

#### Executing the container with a Runtime license

- Execute in shell: `docker run -itd -p 49100:49100 -p 50080:80 -e FTOPTIX_ENTITLEMENT_SERIAL_NUMBER=AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEE ftoptix-updateserver`
    - Make sure to insert a valid serial number in the environment variable

#### Executing the container without a Runtime license

- Execute in shell: `docker run -itd -p 49100:49100 -p 50080:80 ftoptix-updateserver`
    - Without a proper license, the runtime will automatically stop after 120 minutes

### Check the container status

- Execute the following command: `docker ps -a`

```bash
root@ubuntu-VirtualBox:# docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                             NAMES
0af756ce8ada   ftoptix-updateserver   "/opt/Rockwell_Automâ€¦"   10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:49100->49100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:50080->80/tcp,  reverent_wilson
```

### Deploy the FT Optix Application

- Prepare your FT Optix Application by:
    - Removing the NativePresentationEngine
    - Configure the WebPresentationEngine
        - Set the IP address to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
        - Set the Port to `80` (or any value you configured as internal port of the container)
        - Set the Protocol to `http`

![FT Optix Application preparation](./images/ftoptix-app-setup.png "FT Optix Application setup")

- Once the application is ready, configure the target with the proper ip address and username and proceed with the deployment

![Deployment options](./images/deployment-options.png "Deployment options")

- Proceed with the deployment

![Deploy project](./images/deploy-project.png "Deploy the project to the target")

- Open the WebBrowser and enter the URL: `http://<container_ip>:50080`

## Additional notes

- License is verified every 30 minutes
- If the FT Optix Application is stopped, the license is automatically released
- If the application crashes and the license is not released automatically to FT Hub, you may need to get in touch with the Rockwell Automation Software Tech Support

## Troubleshooting

#### I passed a valid license to the container but the Runtime log says "No license tokens found, FactoryTalk Optix Runtime will be closed in: 120 minutes"

1. Make sure that the license is valid
    - Verify trough FT Hub that the license is available to be used
    - Verify that the size of the license is big enough to run the application (license tokens count >= application tokens count)
2. Investigate the license SDK
    - Open a shell prompt on the host machine
    - Identify the container name with `docker ps -a`
    - Connect to the running container with `docker exec -it [container name] bash`
    - Browse to `/root/Rockwell_Automation/FactoryTalk_Optix/FTOptixApplication/Log/FTOptixLicenseSDK/`
    - Inspect the `FTOptixLicenseSDK.log`
        - Here you should see the error (timeout,  invalid license key etc.)
        - If there are issues that cannot be solved locally please get in touch with Rockwell Automation Software Tech Support

```bash
root@ubuntu-VirtualBox:# docker ps -a
ONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS                                                                                               NAMES

```

#### My application crashed, how can I investigate the issue?

- Access the FT Optix Application logs
    - Open a shell prompt on the host machine
    - Identify the container name with `docker ps -a`
    - Connect to the running container with `docker exec -it [container name] bash`
    - Browse to `/root/Rockwell_Automation/FactoryTalk_Optix/FTOptixApplication/Log/`
    - Inspect the `FTOptixRuntime.0.log`
- Contact Rockwell Automation Software Tech Support if needed

#### How can I set the container to restart automatically if the UpdateServer fails?

- Execute the container with: `docker run -itd -p 49100:49100 -p 50080:80 -e FTOPTIX_ENTITLEMENT_SERIAL_NUMBER=AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEE --restart unless-stopped ftoptix-updateserver`

#### How can I make the application folder persistent to avoid deploying my application every time the container starts?

- The FT Optix application folder can be persisted by running the container with:  `docker run -itd -p 49100:49100 -p 50080:80 -e FTOPTIX_ENTITLEMENT_SERIAL_NUMBER=AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEE -v /path/on/host:/root/Rockwell_Automation/FactoryTalk_Optix/FTOptixApplication ftoptix-updateserver`
    - Make sure to replace `path/on/host` with a valid path on the host machine where the FT Optix Application is stored when the container is restarted

#### How do I change the deployment password of the UpdateServer?

The UpdateServer will use the local machine's account to authenticate itself against the FactoryTalk Optix Studio. To change the deployment password you can:

- Change the default password while creating the container:
    - Open the Dockerfile
    - Change the content of: `RUN echo "root:FactoryTalkOptix" | chpasswd`, here you can replace `FactoryTalkOptix` with any valid password you wish

- Change the default password of a running container
    - Access the container's shell using: `docker exec -it [container name] bash`
    - Execute: `echo "root:FactoryTalkOptix" | chpasswd`, here you can replace `FactoryTalkOptix` with any valid password you wish
